Internet is broken

Internet started as huge promise of decentralization & democratization of knowledge and information, both in the consuming and in publishing sense. Before internet, one had to have a newspaper or a broadcaster (or a book publishing company) under control to get their message across to general public. The same goes for music & videos. 
Publishing your own music & video work, and putting it before eyes & ears of global audience meant that you had to have a lot of resources. Internet changed this. Today, if one has quality content, and a tiny bit of technical expertise (or a modest investment), they can make their content accessible to anyone with internet access.
The information has been democratized. Knowledge is widely available today. So is publishing. Today, anonymous leakers of classified political information can expect to influence the outcome of elections. Regardless of wether this or other political players have "bought" the media.
There is much greater liquidity of information than ever in history.

We can say that internet has changed things for our civilization as much as Gutenberg's inventions have.

But things are not as bright as they seem. With mass internet adoption came big money, and with big money, big monopolies came along.

Internet has strayed. Turkish government has blocked access to Wikipedia in April 2017 because Wikipedia wouldnt take down an article that claimed Turkey was sponsoring Al Qaeda and ISIL. The ban is still active. Chinese government has blocked between 1/5 and 1/6 of world's population from accessing sites like BBC, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Amnesty International and many, many others. Its called "The Great Firewall of China". 
Years 2016 and 2017 saw huge internet outages, due to DDOS attacks and data-center errors that brought big parts of the internet down.  These events showed how much we depend on single vendors, like Amazon AWS, CDN-s, DNS providers.
We rely on content stored in particular data centers, in certain countries, behind specific internet backbones. These outages were possible due to the structure of the network. 

Considering how cheap the storage is today, and how much of it sits empty on each sides of these outages, and blockades, we should have all the information available to us regardless of the part of the world we are in. 
Not to talk about censorships, server seizures, and similar obstacles.

Our centralized model of data storage, which has been mitigated to a very small degree by CDN providers, is to blame for big wastes in bandwidth & big losses in terms of speed due to latency. If our source data center is geographically too far, we will see significant decrease in loading time / throughput speed of our connection.
