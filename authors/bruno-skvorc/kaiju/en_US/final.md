Earlier this month, CryptoKaiju - a project merging physical toys and digital collectibles in the form of [NFTs](https://bitfalls.com/nft), launched a new item: Jaiantokoin.

This is the second in a line of limited edition figurines, hot on the heels of the Genesis figure we've given out at the last [Blockconf.io](https://blockconf.io) to TokenHunt winners.

Each figurine has an NFC chip in its foot which the owner can use to verify the figure's uniqueness. Stealing a figurine, however, does not transfer ownership to the thief - the ownership is bound to an [Ethereum](https://bitfalls.com/2017/09/19/what-ethereum-compare-to-bitcoin/) address provided on purchase, which means you can cryptographically prove ownership at any point in time should a dispute ever arise.

With this approach, you can be 100% certain that each figure is genuine, unique and - most importantly - yours!

The figures will have special traits - much like [CryptoKitties](https://bitfalls.com/2018/02/18/15-alternatives-cryptokitties-no-idea-existed/) - wherein some will be more or less in demand and thus add to the uniqueness of a character.

If you'd like to start a brand new collection of truly unique and ownership-provable items, this is your chance. Grab a kaiju at [CryptoKaiju.io](https://cryptokaiju.io)!
