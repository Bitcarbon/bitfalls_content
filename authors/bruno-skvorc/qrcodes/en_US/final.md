As evident by the list on [Wallets.Review](https://wallets.review), most wallets support some kind of QR code scanning functionality when picking a recipient. What isn't obvious, however, is how completely unstandardized this space is.

I had initially encountered this problem when paying for lunch with Ether in Croatia:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Paid for takeout with Eth from within <a href="https://twitter.com/ethstatus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ethstatus</a> <a href="https://t.co/JdGQhBk682">pic.twitter.com/JdGQhBk682</a></p>&mdash; Bruno Skvorc (@bitfalls) <a href="https://twitter.com/bitfalls/status/1118490129193164800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 17, 2019</a></blockquote>

This led me [down a rabbit hole of research](https://discuss.status.im/t/sending-limit-per-contact/1179/8) which, after some chatting with other [local payment providers](https://paycek.io/), made me compose this post. Below I'll demonstrate how different wallets read different QR codes, and the chaos that ensues. Please understand:

## QR Codes

The following QR codes are being tested.

Feel free to pay any of those üòè

## The Testing

Only the QR code aspect of the wallets has been tested. For full reviews and other features, see [Wallets Review](https://wallets.review).



## Conclusion

Every system needs to be done with the lowest common denominator in mind. In blockchain payments, the common denominator is low indeed. People who have never been exposed to this technology will be using it, and the process needs to be safe and seamless - not just from fraud and theft, but from themselves. People must not be allowed to fat-finger their way into overpaying, else the only way to protect themselves from spending more than they owe is to not have that much in their account.

Granted, if refunds were easy this problem would be easy to solve too. Alas, some people also pay for goods and services with cryptocurrency from exchanges, to which a refund is impossible. We need to have a serious discussion about standardizing wallets in regards to QR codes, else the mainstream will remain a fantasy at best and a minefield at worst.

_Btw you do NOT want to see how the QR code landscape looks for other chains... this is just Ethereum._
