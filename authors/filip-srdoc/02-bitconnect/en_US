After months and months of warnings on Ponzi schemes and frauds such as OneCoin, Bitconnect and similar, one of them finally come to an end.

On their [blog][link] "Changes coming for the Bitconnect system - Halt of lending and exchange platform" - published on the main Bitconnect website, company said that they shutting down landing and trading platform. After that, the website crashed.

As it's stated, famous Bitconnect website will from now on operate only for wallet service, news and for educational purposes. People who want to continue investing in it can store their BBC coins, which are still available on the other markets, on the Bitconnet wallets. But after this statement, I don't think that kind of people even exist anymore which consequently led to the tremendous decline in price of $10 per coin, which is more than 95% value drop from the last weeks price.

Shutting down landing operations followed immediately after the statement, with the release of all outstanding loans, while its exchange platform will close in 5 days. Bitconnect says that they will transfer investors lending wallet balance to the Bitconnect wallets balance at 363.62 USD which has been calculated based on last 15 days averages of the closing price registered on coinmarketcap.com.

Bitconnet blames bad rumors and the media for its destruction, which were resulted with bigger doubt in their platform. Their business involved a large part of the so-called "Referral program" that often points to the pyramid scheme. In addition to such rumors, Bitconnect also blames warning letters from regulators of Texas and North Carolina as well as the recent DDos attacks on their platform that made it extremely unstable by causing panic among investors.

They said that this isn't the end of the community, but it only throws off some of its current services. That doesn't mean that Bitconnect will soon not come up with new services that they will offer us. Except their BCC coin, the new ICO it's closer than we think. The new "revolutionary" platform called BitconnectX, featured a new coin, called the BCCX coin, which from the BCC coin is different only by color.

We certainly recommend that you study well in what you invest your money. Explore, read and ask. Although we do not provide investment advices, we'll be happy to point out what we consider to be frauds, it wouldn't be the first time we're right.
