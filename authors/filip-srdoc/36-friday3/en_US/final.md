### The Maltese Magnet!

After [Binance][binance] moved its HQ to [Malta][binance], it looks like another [exchange][exc] is following suit: OKEx. OKEx is currently based in Hong Kong which has lately come down hard on [ICOs][ico] and exchanges with rules and restrictions, so a mass exodus to "blockchain island" is in progress.

OKEx's Tim Byun [said][kazao] they're looking forward to cooperating with Malta's government, with which they share values in regards to protecting investors and the public, and in regards to KYC, AML, and further development of [blockchain][bc] technology.

### Guten Morgen, JP Morgan

A lawsuit befell JPMorgan who have been accused of charging exorbitant fees and interest rates for cryptocurrency purchases. The lawsuit came when customers realized they weren't getting the extra fees back.

This big American bank [says][jp] that they disabled crypto purchases with credit cards because of increased risk (same as some [British banks][brit]), but still allow the use of their Chase debit cards for such purchases without extra fees. This proved to be untrue as customers were dramatically overcharged without warning and possibility of refund. JP was collectively sued for a meager 1 million dollars which they will easily cover, and then some.

### European Blockchain Partnership (without Croatia)

Tuesday, April 10th, was the date when 22 EU countries joined a [European Blockchain Partnership][ebp]. The partnership's focus will be [blockchain][bc] technology, regulation and education for the private and public sectors, and maintaining a leading world position in blockchain development.

All other EU countries have been invited to join, though some, like Croatia, have [outright refused][jutarnji] to sign the agreement. The country's [blockchain NGO UBIK][ubik] is working on repairing this relationship and getting the country to join after the fact.

### Central Bank Digital Currencies Yucky, says Switzerland's Central Bank!

[Central Bank Digital Currencies][dkuna] (CBDC) have too many downsides when compared to private cryptocurrencies, says one of the members of Switzerland's National Bank's Board of Executives.

Andr√©a Maechler [said][andrea] private cryptocurrencies carry less risk because [CBDCs][cbdc] might cause a "bank run" - a mass exodus of money from banks - because of private citizen worries about financial stability and bank solvency. She also notes that [cryptocurrencies][cc] don't meet [key requirements to be money][rrif] and although blockchain technology has the potential to reduce transfer costs and increase transparency, it still doesn't satisfy all conditions for RTGS (real-time-gross-settlement) payment systems.

### Vietnam hanging itself by the blockchain noose

This week marked the end of the [biggest ICO scam yet][pincoin]. Pincoin and Ifan, ERC20 tokens, gathered 660 million USD in their ICOs, thereby damaging 32 thousand investors.

This prompted Nguyen Xuan Phuc, the Vietnamese prime minister, to force the government and regulators into intensifying [cryptocurrency][cc] related measures. [He said][link] that cryptocurrencies and ICO crowdfunding obviously took a very wrong turn and that the whole ordeal is a matter of a very high degree of risk for the financial system and general peace in the community. Vietnam's Central Bank was ordered to cease all cryptocurrency related business while the Ministry of Justice is in charge of finishing regulatory definitions as soon as possible.
