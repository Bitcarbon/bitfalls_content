The well known game development studio (Pac-man, Pong, Doom, Driver) and hardware manufacturer of the good old days, Atari, is planning to launch its own [cryptocurrency][cc].

Atari recently bought a 15% share in Infinity Networks - a platform they're currently collaborating with in regards to developing a [blockchain][bc]-based entertainment platform powered by "Atari Tokens".

Atari already had its own Atari Token in the past which gamers could use to make in-game purchases. Whether or not the new token will be used for the same purpose remains to be seen. [They say][link] they're planning to expand their collaboration with Pariplay - a company they're working with on online casinos into which they intend to add cryptocurrency payments. Judging by the translation of [this announcement][link], Atari might be planning to launch another token - the Pong Token - which people will use exclusively in the aforementioned online casino.

It looks like Atari is trying to "pull a Kodak". Kodak partners with companies dealing with blockchain, and lets them use their brand name on products while actually having nothing to do with the technology. Brand name licensing is a big part of Atari's business as well. According to [Bloomberg][izjava], by announcing their [ICO] Atari already doubled their stock price.
