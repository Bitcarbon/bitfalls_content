Let me introduce myself:

## A
###	**51% Attack**
* Consider this concept as sort of a “hostile takeover” of a cryptocurrency; it's possible in theory, but at this time quite unlikely. The process of mining [blocks](https://bitfalls.com/2017/08/20/blockchain-explained-blockchain-works/)  of digital currency data often takes considerable computing time and energy. It's conceivable that a miner or mining pool could expend the computing resources necessary to control more than 50% of the total computing power devoted to the currency's network, and once they have majority control, they could “take over” and do some damage. For example, they could reverse current and new transactions, and could keep new data blocks and currency from being created. They would create more of an interruption than anything else, but they would ***not be able to “steal” currency or hack other investors' accounts***.

### **ADDY** 
* This refers to a cryptocurrency public address (or key). For example: “Tell me your ADDY, please.”(so I can send you money). See more about wallets and adding currency [here]( https://bitfalls.com/2017/08/31/what-cryptocurrency-wallet/).

### **Alt Coins** 
* *Any coin* that is not bitcoin is an alt coin. There is no getting around this. If you are not bitcoin you're ALT - while there is some debate about what you become after you fork out from the original [blockchain](https://bitfalls.com/2017/08/20/blockchain-explained-blockchain-works/). So, we have some clones like ETH and ETC, BTC and BCH which were made out of the same blockchain. But the development of the forked coin afterwards continues in its own direction. Imagine the trunk of the tree. It is one towards one point until it branches out and the branches in its own direction. This weird tree has only 2 branches. Some become the part of the treetop some wither and die.

### **ASIC** 
* Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) - is a computer chip created to perform one specific function and only that function. Since mining of cryptocurrency data [blocks](https://bitfalls.com/2017/08/20/blockchain-explained-blockchain-works/) can demand a lot of computer space and time, some miners set aside entire devices—or partition off a section of their computers — to do nothing but mining. It usually looks a little brick you can see [here](www.bitmain.com) - in a nutshell you plug it into the wall and Internet so it starts the mining process(it does require a bit more tweaking). 

### **ASA** 
* Asymmetric Key Algorithm - This is the algorithm used to generate public and private keys, the unique codes that are essential to cryptocurrency transactions - Makes sure everyone gets their coins when they move around. See more [here](https://bitfalls.com/2017/08/31/what-cryptocurrency-wallet/).

### **ATH** 
* All time high. Time when you party like the Wolf of Wall Street. This means that the price of a certain cryptocurrency or coin has broken all of its past records and is trading at the highest price it has ever achieved. (Initial ATH can be short lived, when it retraces. But pending good results it moves back into the position.)

## B

### **Bagholder** 
* *One word*. It defines what you will become if you, mildly said, succumb to FOMO and to buy- what you think will be - the next Bitcoin. If you are praying you can get back half of what you put in (you won’t)- you are a bagholder or more simply put - stuck with 1000 horses when the car got adopted as a mean of transportation.

### **Bear Trap** 
* This is a manipulation of a stock or commodity by investors. Traders who “set” the bear trap do so by selling stock until it fools other investors into thinking its upward trend in value has stopped, or is dropping. Those who fall into the bear trap will often sell at that time, fearing a further drop in value. At that point, the investors who set the trap will buy at the low price and will release the trap—which is essentially a false bear market. Once the bear trap is released, the value will even out, or even climb.

### **Bitcoin Maximalist** 
* these people have had a great vision for our future(like people who saw how big GOT is in S07 before S01 aired and put all down on it). Actually, it means that most of your portfolio is indeed consisting of Bitcoin as your main investment when we talk about crypto.

### **BPI** 
* Bitcoin Price Index - so you need to know how much is your bitcoin worth in ***REAL MONEY*** - like the one you can currently buy bread with. In 2013, [CoinBase](www.coinbase.com) decided to remedy the situation, and they created the Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). It looks at value on all exchanges and averages it together to balance out the value across the globe. 

### **Block** 
* This is a collection of transaction data, one of the fundamental elements of cryptocurrency. As soon as possible after blocks are created, they're processed by investors for transaction verification; this process is known as mining. See more about blocks [here](https://bitfalls.com/2017/08/20/blockchain-explained-blockchain-works/).

### **Block Chain** 
* Blocks of cryptocurrency transaction data don't stand alone. As they're created and processed, they're interlinked with other blocks into what's known as a block chain. Read more [here](https://bitfalls.com/2017/08/20/blockchain-explained-blockchain-works/).

### **Block Reward** 
* This is the “payoff” given to a miner who has successfully calculated the hash in a data block during the mining process. This is how new coins are born. Portion of those will go to the miner. The new coins minted by the mining process, by the way, are called “virgin” coins, since they're brand new and have not yet been used for any transactions.

### **Blockchain Expert** 
* People who understand and work with [blockchain](https://bitfalls.com/2017/08/20/blockchain-explained-blockchain-works/) are the experts. The rest of us is in the learning process. I mean if you do not understand what "multi sig parity client" means, well - it just means that you need to learn a bit more. Just keep reading. 

### **Bot Trading** 
* There are programs available for investors that have been created to make the process more precise and automatic - as well as present 24/7 as Crypto market never stops working. “Bots” will carry out transactions automatically according to the price criteria the investor has set.

### **Bubble** 
* A bubble occurs when a market is driven upward by investors; this has happened in the dot-com and housing industries in the past decade or so. The more of money going in is like you blow more air into the balloon. The normal movement of the balloon is the movement between breaths - that is what you can see on all the graphs - moving up and down. The difference is that balloon is being blown by millions of others at the same time as you. As you blow air into your balloon it becomes more sensitive to negative impact in form news and/or events – which can puncture holes in this massive thing. So, each hole is leaking a bit of air out, represented by the drops on the graph. But as confidence grows, more air goes in Vs the amount going out. Leaks get fixed by good news and all is well. All until a big impact hits and then more air stars leaving then what is being pushed in. You may have an upper hand or minimize your losses if you anticipate the bad news, by reading and keeping informed. If they are indeed coming you get the chance to inhale your share of air back and you close your position. You basically hold your breath until you feel safe to breathe again, without dying and stuff, and then you reinvest. That is how you grow.

### **Bull Trap** 
* A bull trap is “set” by investors in a stock or commodity who will buy large amounts in order to artificially drive the value upward, or create a false bull market. Traders who are fooled by the bull trap will often buy shares at the inflated price, in the belief that the upward trend will continue and the shares they're buying will rise in value. Unfortunately, those who fell into the bull trap will often be left holding shares for which they paid too much, since once the trap is released, the market evens out, and sometimes even drops. (see Pump'n'Dump)

### **Butthurt** 
* A description of where you will feel the pain when your shitcoin goes to zero or when you wake up on a day when $40 billion market cap melts.

### **Buy Order** 
* A buy order - When you want to buy coins, you open an order saying how much are you ready to pay and what quantity you want to get (“I want to spend x amount of dollars on Bitcoins”). Buy orders don't necessarily guarantee your purchase; if your price is too low, for example, the offer may expire without being filled unless you make adjustments.

## C

### **Candlestick Chart** 
* This is a popular at-a-glance type of chart that is commonly used in stock and commodity exchanges. Candlestick charts are ideal for showing day-to-day market activity in a concise—but still accurate—way, denoting the full range of activity for that period. ![Candlestick Chart](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Candlestick_chart_scheme_03-en.svg)

### **Choyna**
* A distortion of “China,” a country that is hugely influential to bitcoin because it’s where quite a considerable chunk of trading occurs and currently most mining activity occurs. (Bitcoins are “mined” by powerful computers running labor-intensive algorithms).

### **Classic** 
* A common name referred to something that is more than two years old.  Ethereum Classic, Bitcoin Classic etc… In this case developers tend to name the forked coins - Classic - meaning that they stem from the original [blockchain](https://bitfalls.com/2017/08/20/blockchain-explained-blockchain-works/) and trying to keep the values (what sentimental what practical) or the original idea intact, just further improving it. 

### **Cloud Mining**
* Would like to mine with your own PC? Well unless you have a lot of space and sound insulation this might not be the best choice. But in case you are not willing or you are unable to do this on your own, you can go to some of the companies online who do offer this service. These companies invest in the hardware that allows for high-end mining power, and they in turn lease the access to this mining capability to third parties. As an individual miner, this means you can sign a contract that allows you to use a predetermined amount of mining power through cloud computing, without the hassle. For the individual rules and information on how this operates, you will need to read the FAQ the service of choice.

### **Confirmation**
* When a block of transaction information is successfully processed, or mined, all the transactions within that data block are considered confirmed, or validated. Depending on the type of cryptocurrency, the confirmation time for transactions can vary anywhere from 30 seconds to several minutes; longer validation times—though considered a small inconvenience to those making transactions—are generally considered to be more secure, since a “closer look” is being given to the data as it is mined.  * For most intents and purposes, a transaction is considered “official” after one level of confirmation; however, some exchanges and merchants will wait until several levels of confirmation have taken place before the funds related to the transaction are unfrozen. This practice helps guard against double-spending of digital currency, or using the same currency for more than one transaction.

### **Continuation Graph Pattern**
* When you take a look at a market value graph on a digital currency exchange site, you'll be able to see at a glance the upward (“bull” market) and downward (“bear” market) trend lines. However, on occasion you'll see graph patterns that show fluctuations that go against the flow of the current trend, only for the trend to continue in the same direction afterward. This type of graph pattern is known as a "continuation” type; though there may be momentary up-and-down movement in a currency's value, from a macro view the trend hasn't really changed direction. Continuation graph patterns show that investors have tested the current trend and found it to be sound—therefore, it continues. This is actually a brotherhood of graphs. See [here](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns)

### **Crypto Anarchist** 
* Someone who totally hates the government. Until he gets scammed. Then he calls the SEC.

### **Cryptocurrency**
* Crypto is a word root that comes from the Greek for “hidden” or to hide;” for example, cryptography is the process of coding written messages. [Cryptocurrency](https://bitfalls.com/2017/08/20/cryptocurrency/) is a financial tool that takes the form of long blocks of alphanumeric code, and this alternative currency is traded between investors and used as a form of payment for goods and services to merchants who accept it.  
* Unlike traditional bill-and-coin currency such as the US dollar, cryptocurrency is not directly tied in to any government, corporation or bank, and is therefore not susceptible to inflation, regulations or charges and fees that affect traditional legal tender. This does not mean that Crypto is not very [volatile](https://bitfalls.com/2017/09/12/tweets-destroy-markets-fud-chinese-bitcoin-bans/). Cryptocurrencies are relatively new; the first to be publicly introduced was Bitcoin in 2009. Cryptocurrency is also known by the terms “digital currency” and “alternative currency.”

### **Cup and Handle Pattern**
* This is a pattern that appears on market value graphs when investors want to test the validity of an upward, or “bullish,” trend in a commodity market. The upward trend, due to investor buying and selling, will gradually slope downward, then back up again, in a gently-sloping “Letter U” shape. After this “cup” is formed, the market will be tested again briefly, making a quick downward slope that's considerably smaller (and shorter in duration) than the “cup” preceding it; this then forms the “handle” to the teacup shape. The cup and handle is considered a “continuation” pattern, in that, once the handle is formed, the upward trend will continue. See more [here](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns:cup_with_handle_continuation)


## D

### **Day Trading**
* This is the practice of buying and/or selling a stock or commodity, with the beginning-to-end process of the trade taking place all within the same calendar day. Day traders look for small price shifts minute-to-minute, and do their best to maximize their profits (or at least minimize their losses) by making several transactions a day—but without leaving any business unfinished overnight. Day traders depend on “micro-trends,” which are minuscule shifts in market value, as compared to regular traders, who may observe the trends of a stock or commodity over several days, weeks or months before taking action.

### **Dead Cat Bounce**
* In market trading terms, this somewhat unsavory phrase relates to a momentary recovery in a downward trend for a stock or commodity, such as cryptocurrency. When there's a bear market—that is to say, a market in which a commodity's values are steadily moving downward—there are two types of recovery. The first type is a true recovery, in which the downward slide is reversed over a long period of time, and prices trend upward consistently. The second type is the “dead cat bounce.” The price trend—which has been going downward for a long period of time—shifts upward briefly, usually for no more than a week or two at most. Dead cat bounces can occur in miniature—over the space of a few hours or days—but most analysts consider this version a minor blip in the market as opposed to calling it a “true” dead cat bounce. No matter the bounce's duration, it's a false recovery, and the downward trend in valuation continues afterward. The term comes from an old—and slightly disturbing—saying, “Even a dead cat will bounce if it falls from a great height.”

### **Decentralized**
* This is a term you'll hear often when cryptocurrency is being discussed. In this context, it means the currency isn't issued or controlled by a centralized authority, such as a bank or government. While this means cryptocurrency isn't directly affected by inflation or governmental regulations—which its advocates insist makes for a more level international playing field—it also means its investors carry more responsibility for its well-being. They should be aware of the risks inherent with cryptocurrency, such as value [fluctuation](https://bitfalls.com/2017/09/12/tweets-destroy-markets-fud-chinese-bitcoin-bans/) and the lack of institutional protections against theft and fraud. There's no FDIC for digital currency—as there is in the centralized US banking system—so once it's stolen, it's gone forever.

### **Deflation**
* Generally speaking, in the financial sense deflation refers to a decline in prices of consumer goods. On the surface, this may seem like a good thing; after all, you're paying less for your groceries, clothing and so forth. However, a sustained period of deflation can have negative effects on an economic system overall, because it represents reduced spending power in the population at large. Longer periods of deflation can lead to recessionary periods, and—in severe cases—depression. Governments and banks will often take steps to induce temporary inflation, or the rising of prices, to curb the effects of long-term deflation. As history has shown, these actions have had varied degrees of success.
* Deflation can also refer to the falling prices or values of assets, such as homes, cars and investments such as cryptocurrency. Severe asset or equity deflation can result in an “underwater” situation; for example, if you are a homeowner, and the current appraised value of your house is less than what you paid for it, in that specific case you would be considered underwater. The same can happen with a digital currency portfolio; however, most periods of deflation tend to be corrected over time—so knee-jerk reactions such as selling off an investment can, in the long run, prove to be unwise.

### **Demurrage**
* This is a charge levied against the accounts of investors who don't use their digital currency for transactions, but just leave it sitting as a long-term investment. Some cryptocurrencies use this as a way to keep their currency in circulation, and to prevent hoarding. After all, it's in the issuer's best interest to keep their currency active; it makes it more stable and supports its value. If you're looking to invest in cryptocurrency—and not necessarily use it for purchases—you'll want to shop around to see which ones carry demurrage fees. (Freicoin, Insanity coin destroys 10% per transaction so it is not technically demurrage in traditional economic terms).

### **Difficulty**
* The term “difficulty” here refers to how easily a data block of transaction information can be mined successfully. Each type of cryptocurrency has algorithms (such as SHA-256 and Script) that determine the mining difficulty for their corresponding coins—and adjust those difficulties as circumstances warrant.
* Setting the difficulty for cryptocurrency mining is a challenge, one that needs to strike a delicate balance. Make the process too easy, and miners will flood the market with too many new coins created by the mining process. Make it too difficult, and miners will lose interest in taking part. The latter has become an issue with more popular digital currencies like Bitcoin; its difficulty has risen to the point that most individual miners can't justify the added cost of specialized mining machinery. Collective mining (where miners can contract mining power from third parties) has eased this somewhat, but many prospective miners are looking for newer and “easier” currencies to mine.  

### **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**
* To anyone who maintains any kind of online presence, this term represents a potential nightmare. The letters DDoS are almost always followed by the word “attack,”. A DDoS attack begins when the attacker rounds up hundreds, if not thousands, of “zombie” computers; this is achieved by downloading Trojans or viruses onto remote computers without the owner knowing. Once the zombie network is in place, the attacker targets one website, email server or network, and directs all the zombie computers to flood the victim with tasks or requests. This coordinated attack can bring a website or network to its knees; DDoS attacks commonly crash servers and make websites temporarily disappear until the attack can be traced and halted. Several cryptocurrency exchanges have been the targets of DDoS attacks, which are often politically or personally motivated.
* Webmasters and server owners can avoid DDoS attacks with powerful security measures such as firewalls, but the main issue remains in the hands of individual computer owners. Since the “zombie” Trojans and viruses tend to work invisibly in the background, the members of a zombie computer network never know they're part of it. In order to avoid such an infestation, computer owners should download a current (and easily updated) security program that searches their systems for malware and spyware.

### **Double Bottom Pattern**
* Double bottom pattern forms on a market chart when investors buy and sell to test a downward trend in value. Buying and selling will take place, and over time this will form two distinct and almost-equal valleys on the chart's trend line. Once the second valley has formed, an upward trend will develop past the point of the peaks or tops formed during the pattern's formation. Once that happens, the market is likely to be “bullish,” or upward-trending, for a while; thus, the double bottom pattern is considered a “reversal” pattern, transitioning from a bear to a bull market.![Double Bottom](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/59/Double_bottom_confirmation.jpg)

### **Double Spending**
* Those who turn a critical and skeptical eye on the cryptocurrency industry insist that double spending is the biggest flaw in the concept. Since digital currency is 100% electronic, the argument goes, there's no accounting for one electronic coin being spent more than once. And, indeed, it has been tried many times; a holder of an alternate currency coin will spend it in one place, and will turn around and use its unique code for a transaction somewhere else.
* This cynical argument, however, tends to assume there are no safeguards in place for this kind of fraud—and that couldn't be further from the truth. For all types of cryptocurrency, there is a validation system in place, and it happens as data blocks are mined, or verified. For example, if Coin A is used for Transaction B, all is well and good; when the data block for that transaction is mined, the transaction is confirmed, and that's that. But, let's say our unscrupulous coin holder turns around and tries to use the code for Coin A for Transaction C a little while later. When the data block for Transaction C is mined, a red flag is raised, because the code for Coin A—which has already been electronically “spent”—has been duplicated. As a result, Transaction C will not be confirmed; instead, it will be rejected. So, yes, in theory double spending is an issue with cryptocurrency. But in practice, security measures built into the mining process doesn't allow it to happen.


### **Double Bottom Pattern**
* A form on a market chart when investors buy and sell to test a downward trend in value. Buying and selling will take place, and over time this will form two distinct and almost-equal valleys on the chart's trend line. Once the second valley has formed, an upward trend will develop past the point of the peaks or tops formed during the pattern's formation. Once that happens, the market is likely to be “bullish,” or upward-trending, for a while; thus, the double bottom pattern is considered a “reversal” pattern, transitioning from a bear to a bull market.

### **Double Top Pattern**
* A form on a market chart when investors buy and sell to test an upward trend in value. Buying and selling will take place, and over time this will form two distinct and almost-equal peaks on the chart's trend line. Once the second peak has formed, a downward trend will develop past the point of the dips or valleys formed during the pattern's formation. Once that happens, the market is likely to be “bearish,” or downward-trending, for a while; thus, the double top pattern is considered a “reversal” pattern, transitioning from a bull to a bear market. ![Double Top](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/81/Doubletop_confirmed.jpg)


## E 
### **Ecosystem**
* usage of this rhetoric is more pronounced the more you approach a potential shitcoin by being more verbose in attempt to seem sophisticated and complex. Be careful as it might be a sophisticated and complex system designed to separate you from your money. In more down to earth terms, e.g. Apple Eco system - Once you get invested in Apps for your Mac, or for apps on your iOS device etc. - That means you are invested in their Ecosystem and it becomes increasingly difficult to cross over to - Android or God forbid - Windows Phone. [(RIP)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2017/07/12/microsoft-windows-phone-windows10-mobile-strategy/)

## **Escrow**
* This is the act of having a third party store the funds for a transaction in a temporary account until the details of the trade can be acknowledged and approved by the two chief parties involved. Digital currency exchanges often use escrow accounts when large amounts of currency are being traded; this allows the traders to do research not only on each other, but on other factors that may affect the transaction. When the payer and the payee are both satisfied with the transaction details, they notify the escrow holder (in this case, the exchange representative), who releases the funds to the recipient.

### **Exchange**
* An exchange is a service where cryptocurrency investors go to buy and sell their currency of choice. Like [Bittrex](www.bittrex.com), [Coinbase](www.coinbase.com), [Kraken](www.kraken.com), [Poloniex](www.poloniex.com), [BTCC](https://www.btcchina.com), [OKCoin](https://www.okcoin.cn), etc. Heart of an exchange is the premise of a secure third-party location where transactions can take place—but not all exchanges are alike. For example, some sell cryptocurrency directly to investors and buy from them as well — whereas some simply offer a platform where buyers and sellers can connect. Investors can find market values, exchange rates, and other trading information on exchange web sites, and many exchanges offer [wallet]((https://bitfalls.com/2017/08/31/what-cryptocurrency-wallet/)) services, too. Several exchanges also maintain directories of merchants who accept cryptocurrency as payment.

### **Exchange Rate**
* With traditional currency, this term refers to the comparative worth of one government-issued currency(FIAT) to another. If you are buying an item abroad you are looking at how much you are spending in your own currency to better understand the value of items. As *Crypto* is decentralized and borderless this has a slightly different meaning. When you look at the value of Bitcoin you are usually comparing it to one of the FIAT currencies such as USD to see how much you have in *REAL MONEY* aka the directly spendable amount if you convert it. Furthermore, the 2nd comparison can be between different currencies and pairs like BTC/ETH similar to USD/EUR pairs.

## F

### **F.U.D.**
* Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt. This is usually disseminated by people and/or companies to put others at a disadvantage. See more [here](https://bitfalls.com/2017/09/12/tweets-destroy-markets-fud-chinese-bitcoin-bans/).

### **Falling Wedge**
* Belonging to the brotherhood of Reversal patterns and trends, but can switch sides depending on the situation. In the general speaking it is a bullish pattern that begins wide at the top and contracts as prices move lower. This price action forms a cone that slopes down as the reaction highs and reaction lows converge. This bias cannot be realized until a resistance breakout.

* The falling wedge can also fit into the continuation category. As a continuation pattern, the falling wedge will still slope down, but the slope will be against the prevailing uptrend. As a reversal pattern, the falling wedge slopes down and with the prevailing trend. Regardless of the type (reversal or continuation), falling wedges are regarded as bullish patterns. See more [here](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns:falling_wedge_reversal).

### **Faucet**
* = Free stuff for promotional purposes. There are many places online where those interested can stop by and request some shiny virtual coins for free. The sites that offer free digital currency are called “faucets”.
* The amounts of currency given away on faucet sites are quite small, and they offer just enough of a taste to get potential investors interested. Some of them require you to have a central address registered like [Faucethub](https://faucethub.io) and use that generated address to redeem the micro portions on affiliate websites. Usually when sharks taste blood in the water they are attracted to the source of it. It is designed to drive traffic and incremental sales through direct and indirect financing. On occasion, either lack of investor interest or shortage of funding will cause a faucet site to shut down; when that happens—in keeping with the terminology—that faucet is said to have *gone dry*.

### **FIAT Currency**
* Main point. Not an Italian car company.
* “Fiat” is the Latin word for “it shall be,” so that translation isn't of much help to us here. In a nutshell, a fiat currency is a financial tool that is not backed up by any physical commodity or goods; essentially, it exists and flourishes simply because the people have faith that the value is stable and sustainable enough for them to trust it, regardless of its fragility. It should be mentioned that most cryptocurrencies in the world—are fiat currency systems since the transition on their gold/silver reserve, oil or other goods dependency. **ALL** Currency has a tendency to fail, if the faith is lost - Remember the Communist countries where you needed an armful of cash to buy milk as the value of money plummeted. Vietnam to this date is one of the easiest places to become a [millionaire](https://c1.staticflickr.com/7/6192/6032133563_2c66cf8b8c_b.jpg)

### **Fib Retracement Levels**
* Technical analysis system that can predict crypto price corrections. Also, the amount of money you can lose using this system is proportional to a [Fibonacci spiral](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/FibonacciSpiral.svg).

### **Fill or Kill**
* This is a simple type of buy order. You say - how much currency you want and what are you ready to pay for it. If the supply/demand hasn't been met for your order by the cutoff date, the order is canceled and left unfilled. In other words, fill this order according to these guidelines and within this time frame. If you can't, kill it.


### **Flag Pattern**
* This pattern forms on market value charts when investors want to test a current trend in a commodity's value. The buying and selling that takes place during this testing period—which generally lasts one to three weeks—forms fluctuations that can be bracketed by parallel diagonal lines, forming the “flag” shape. (times in crypto are usually shorter then in traditional markets, keep in mind this is wall street on steroids). 
* Flag patterns can occur during both upward-trending (“bear”) and downward-trending (“bull”) markets. Since they don't signify the current trend is going to reverse, the flag pattern is considered one of the “continuation” pattern types. Once the pattern is formed, the trend will continue moving in the direction it had been beforehand.![Bear flag](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Bear-flag-example.jpg)


### **FOMO**
* The fear of missing out. You see and hear how everyone is buying Lambos and turning their life around. True. But don't buy on the top in FOMO because if the market turns and you are still holding the bags, you will learn what is to be a bagholder. General rule of thumb is to buy when the market is in the correction mode aka in RED. When the market goes green you sell.  

###	**Fonts**
* This isn't so much a “what” as it is a “who.” Fontas is a mysterious investor or group of investors who has been using pump and dump schemes to manipulate the value of various digital currencies. That is to say, he/she/they have been buying large amounts of currency at low prices, then they've used misleading information to get other investors to buy, falsely inflating the currency's price. At that point, Fontas sells a large chunk of their cryptocurrency investment for a sizable profit. (Pump'n'Dump)

### **Fork**
* Not a cutlery reference. It refers in fact to the fork in the road, path or flow.![Fork](https://www.goodfreephotos.com/albums/united-states/tennessee/big-south-fork-national-river-and-recreation-area/aerial-view-of-big-south-fork-tennessee.jpg)
* In duration of development of some Cryptocurrencies they may decide split up like an amoeba. The two [blockchains](https://bitfalls.com/2017/08/20/blockchain-explained-blockchain-works/) are the exact copies at the time of the split or FORK, resulting the people who have the X amount of coin on one blockchain to receive the same amount of the new forged coin on the new created blockchain. After the fork, each coin continues independent development and goes in its own direction, or in the worst-case scenario gets abandoned and disappears. Samples are ETH and ETC, BTC and BCH where both chains are still present and developing. ![The Split](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Neutrophil_with_anthrax_copy.jpg)


### **Genesis Block**
* In the cryptocurrency mining process, blocks of data are processed and validated one by one, and each of these blocks are linked in chronological order, forming what is called a block chain. But every chain has to start somewhere, and the very first block of data mined in order to launch an alternate currency is known, appropriately enough, as a “Genesis block.” The main way in which a Genesis block differs from all the other blocks on the chain following it is that the Genesis block will have its “previous hash” data set to all zeroes. This indicates that no other data was processed before the block in question; all other blocks will have other numbers in this data field.
* *The most famous collector’s edition* of the Genesis block generated was Block 0 of the Bitcoin chain, created by the currency's founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, in January 2009. 

###	**Graph Gaps**
* On occasion, gaps will appear in trend lines on market value graphs. These gaps indicate a visible drop or rise in a commodity's value that hasn't necessarily happened due to trading. These can be the result of closed markets, statistical adjustments by analysts, or by strong news about the commodity. There are three types of [gaps](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:gaps_and_gap_analysis):

>Breakaway Gap. These appear at the ***beginning*** of a strong upward or downward trend, and represent very high-volume trading.
>
>Runaway Gap. These occur ***during*** an upward or downward trend, and represent a quick momentary intensification of that trend.
>
>Exhaustion Gap. This occurs ***toward the end*** of an upward or downward trend, and tends to indicate a small trend in the opposite direction.


## H

###	**Hash**
* [HASH](https://bitfalls.com/2017/08/20/blockchain-explained-blockchain-works/) is a random and complex mathematical formula used in the verification of blocks of transaction data in the process known as mining. Once a miner calculates the proper hash in a block, they're rewarded with coins and a percentage of the transaction fees embedded in that block. Achieving the right hash in a given block can take several tries and calculation adjustments—and some blocks, even though properly processed, may not “pay out.” Miners mostly do not work together but are competing against each other in order to calculate the HASH and keep the Block Reward to themselves. If you are not in possession of huge amount of HASH power, then mining pools - Places where you and me join our forces with other people and stand a chance in the Darwinian crypto world. In that case if the whole pool calculates the HASH everyone reaps the reward.

### **Hash Rate**
* The hash rate is the speed at which complex mathematical calculations are performed in the mining of cryptocurrency data blocks. What this measurement boils down to is: the higher the hash rate of a mining system, the more data blocks can be successfully mined—which in turn means more block rewards for the miner or miners involved. The Hash becomes more difficult to calculate and increases over time in order to keep the value and rate stabile. The following terms are used for mining hash rate measurement:

>KH/s: Kilohashes per second, or 1000 hash computations/s (10^3)
>
>MH/s: Megahashes per second, or 1 million hash computations/s (10^6)
>
>GH/s: Gigahashes per second, or 1 billion hash computations/s (10^9)
>
>TH/s: Terrahashes per second, or 1 trillion hash computations (10^12)
>
>PH/s: Petahashes per second, or 1 quadrillion hash computations (10^15)

### **Head and Shoulders Pattern**
* The head and shoulders pattern forms on a market value chart when two smaller fluctuations in value bracket a larger one in the middle. ![Head and Shoulders Graph](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2c/H_and_s_top_new.jpg)


### **HODLing**
* Typos can make you famous. On one of the more known [forums](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0) HOLD was mistyped and the term was coined as we know it today. It is a meme of constant amusement, because hodling a shitcoin is not the way to go. You will hear this battlecry in the times of market corrections to tell you that better times should arise and not to succumb to sales under the paid price. “HODL” – “Hold on for dear life”.

###	**Hybrid Wallet**
* This is a cryptocurrency storage and maintenance system that is a combination of a software [wallet](https://bitfalls.com/2017/08/31/what-cryptocurrency-wallet/) (stored on your home computer) and a web wallet (stored on a third-party server). The bulk of your digital currency account information is stored on the wallet host's server—except for one important detail. Your private key (the code that uniquely identifies you) is stored only on your own device. When you make a transaction, your private key is encrypted on the way to the exchange's server, so they never know what your private key is. This is an impressive security feature, but access to your private key also includes a password that—again--only you know. If you lose or forget that password, access to your account could be denied, and you could potentially lose your account balance forever. Tricky huh? See more about wallets [here]( https://bitfalls.com/2017/08/31/what-cryptocurrency-wallet/) .

## I

### **Inflation**
* In financial terms, inflation indicates the general trend of rising prices for consumer goods and services. As a result—unless consumers' income matches the rate of inflation—it means consumers have a lower level of purchasing power as prices go up. Banks and governments often do whatever they can to stop long periods of excessive inflation, just as they do the same for its opposite, deflation—or a sustained drop in prices. Though inflation is a natural financial process, most countries try to keep the rate of inflation at a more manageable level of 2-3%; the majority of consumers are able to adapt more readily to these rates. 

## L 

### **Litecoin**
* This type of cryptocurrency was introduced to the public in October of 2011, the first major player to do so since Bitcoin in 2009. Even though a significant number of cryptocurrencies has cropped up since then, Litecoin holds the number two spot behind Bitcoin in order of appearance when we talk major coins, and it's gaining ground as Bitcoin prices surge out of the range of some investors' budgets. Litecoin uses the Scrypt mining algorithm, and is mined by the proof-of-work method. The 2nd as a number in order of appearance should not be confused with market capitalization. 

## M

### **Mining**
* Cryptocurrency transactions are bundled together in packets of data that are called [blocks](https://bitfalls.com/2017/08/20/blockchain-explained-blockchain-works/). The timely processing of these blocks is essential to the health of cryptocurrency, and since there's no one central entity that can carry out all this processing on their own, it's done by the currency's investors. This is called mining, and the miners are offered incentives to take on the task. When a block of data is properly mined, and specific predetermined algorithmic and mathematical criteria (known collectively as “hash”) have been met, the miners collect a reward of coins and a percentage of the transaction fees from the block they've processed. It should be noted mining is more a perk than a requirement; you can invest in cryptocurrency without mining, if you wish.
* Mining serves a dual purpose; not only does it validate transactions, but it results in minting of new cryptocurrency. 

### **Mining Pools**
* In many cases, the process of mining can be a resource hog; it can eat up a lot of processing time and space on computers. Since most individual miners don't have the computing power or the hardware to dedicate one or more machines strictly to mining, they'll join with other miners to distribute the processing burden. When more than one miner is involved in the processing of data [blocks](https://bitfalls.com/2017/08/20/blockchain-explained-blockchain-works/), this is called a mining pool. Once the mining is completed and verified, the pool's members divide the coin and transaction fee rewards evenly.

### **Mintage Cap**
* It boils down to a very simple concept. Most cryptocurrencies will eventually stop being created when they reach a predetermined amount known as a mintage cap. Bitcoin = [21.000.000](https://bitfalls.com/2017/09/17/bitcoin-finite-just-myth/). That is all. No more no less can exist. That is how the concept works and how it gains power. Limited supply. Once the last coin's created, there won't be any more. In most cases, the cap won't be reached for a number of years—that's by design, so new investors will be allowed to join up for some time to come. The majority of cryptocurrencies have mintage caps set; however, a few—like Peercoin—don't. 

## N

### **Noob Trap**
* “N00b” is an abbreviation for the term “new blood,” and is also sometimes expressed as “newb” or “newbie.” It applies to anyone who is a newcomer to a given community—in this case, investing in digital currency. 
* As in the world of online gaming, there are people who will help you level and there will be people who will want to gank you and take your lunch money. N00bZ can be an easy prey as the lack of knowledge makes them an easy target.
* For better understanding of the types of noob traps there are in the digital currency world, see the terms Bear Trap, Bull Trap and Pump and Dump.

## O

## **Offline Storage**
* Also called - Cold Storage. It directly relates to the way your Cryptocurrency is stores - Cold or offline means exactly that. It is stored on the device/computer that is in no way attached to the internet so it cannot be hacked or compromised. The best way to do this is not to trust any 3rd party with this, but get your own offline cold storage. Luckily, we have you covered [here](https://bitfalls.com/shop/ledger-nano-s-bitfalls-consultation/)

## P
 
### **Paper Wallet**
* Yes. Finally, you can print your own money without being locked up. 
* Paper wallet is just that - Printable code, usually a QR code that can be scanned and then the money is deposited in the account of choice. Be mindful, avoid water and washing machines as well as waving it around as if someone takes a photo of it, and deposits it, there is no way back. As once the amount is sent, you are unable to retrieve it. See more about wallet options [here](https://bitfalls.com/2017/08/31/what-cryptocurrency-wallet/) .

### **Peer-to-Peer**
* Made popular by the Napster generation also abbreviated as P2P, this is a concept that's central to cryptocurrency. Transactions are made between individuals (peers), with no interruption or dictation from a centralized authority. 

### **Pennant Pattern**
* This pattern similar in its nature to the fag pattern also forms on market value charts when investors want to test a current trend in a commodity's value. See more [here](http://www.investopedia.com/university/charts/charts6.asp)

### **Phone-to-Phone Transfer**
* This is a mobile application feature that allows the instantaneous transfer of information from one smartphone to another. If two mobile device users want to exchange data, and both have this feature installed and activated on their phones, they can make the transfer simply by having their devices in close proximity to each other. These are also sometimes called “touch transfers.” 
* Many digital currency applications include this as a feature, so currency trades can be made from one mobile [wallet](https://bitfalls.com/2017/08/31/what-cryptocurrency-wallet/) to another instantly.

### **Platform Exchange**
* This is a digital currency exchange that *limits* the role they play in transactions made between investors. The majority of exchanges are there to facilitate these transactions, and make them easier to carry out. The exchange will sort through buy and sell orders, and will then match up investors who meet the criteria of the order in question. Their algorithms are designed so the trades being made are both secure and fair to both parties involved. Beyond that, however, the exchange does not play any “middleman” or mediating role. This is in contrast to exchanges that will hold the transaction funds in escrow, or will discuss the details of the trade with both investors before moving forward.

### **PoS vs. PoW** 
* Proof of Stake Vs Proof of Work - They both have advantages and disadvantages. One can scale, but is insecure and the other is secure, but can’t scale. The improvements on individual [blockchains](https://bitfalls.com/2017/08/20/blockchain-explained-blockchain-works/) are trying to overcome the negative aspects of each mode of work. 

### **Private Key**
* This unique identifier code is issued to investors to be used as a digital signature during transactions. Compared to public keys—which are openly listed in the directories of many cryptocurrency exchanges—private keys are to be just that: closely guarded and not given out. Your private key is what you use when you receive a transfer—from an investor who encrypts it with your public key—to “sign” your approval of the transaction. Private keys should be treated with just or more reverence they what you would do with your wallet and other sensitive information. See more [here]( https://bitfalls.com/2017/08/31/what-cryptocurrency-wallet/) .

### **Proof-of-Stake Mining**
* Rewards for this type of mining are based upon the amount you've already invested in the cryptocurrency in question. The more currency you hold, the higher your potential rewards for mining will be. Proof-of-stake mining, as of yet, is not used as a stand-alone method, but is used by some cryptocurrency issuers in combination with proof-of-work Mining.

### **Proof-of-Work Mining**
* The rewards for this type of mining are straightforward: you receive coins and transaction fee rewards in direct correlation to the actual mining work you do. As such, the more mining you do, the more you can make. With some major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Litecoin, this is the only type of mining option available; however, some use a combination of proof-of-work and proof-of-stake mining.

### **Public Key**
* This is a unique encrypted code issued to an investor. When they want to make a transaction with their cryptocurrency, they give their public key out—many cryptocurrency exchanges have a directory of these for their investors—so the transfer can be made. The public key is a way to positively identify someone making a transaction, even though their actual name or personal information is not embedded in the key itself. Contrast this with a private key—which is not publicly known, and should be closely guarded—which is used to accept and validate a transaction. See more [here]( https://bitfalls.com/2017/08/31/what-cryptocurrency-wallet/) .

### **Pump and Dump**
* This is a market strategy that's strongly frowned upon by conscientious investors. An individual or group will invest heavily in a stock or commodity when its price is low, and will then publicize it aggressively, often using misleading or outright false statements. This is the “pump” part of the term, and it's designed to get other investors interested and to drive the price upward. Once that happens, the individual or group will sell off their shares at a higher price; this often results in a profit for them, but it also creates a drop in the commodity's value. This is the “dump” part, and needless to say, does not please the other investors.

## Q

### **QR Code**
* These are a lot like the rectangular bar codes you'll find on just about anything you buy, except QR codes are square in shape and can hold more information than bar codes. Merchants who accept cryptocurrency as payment—as well as other types of currency—will often display QR codes in their stores. All the customer has to do is scan the QR code with their smartphone, and it will direct them to a URL where they can make the purchase right then and there, without the inconvenience of waiting in line at a cash register. Most digital currency mobile apps include QR code-scanning capability. For example, payment structure in China is based all around payments with your phone. WeChat Pay and AliPay are the majority market and CC and Cash are on the way OUT! Some places reject payment by cash. QR code example:

<a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.qrcode-generator.de' border='0' style='cursor:default'><img src='https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=qr&chl=www.bitfalls.com&chs=180x180&choe=UTF-8&chld=L|2' alt=''></a>


## R

### **Rekt**
* You discover that you were the last person to ever place an order to buy that shitcoin or how you feel after you fell into any number of Noob traps.

### **Reversal Graph Pattern**
* This is a type of pattern that forms on market value charts you'll see on many digital currency exchange websites. A reversal pattern indicates that a market that has been trending upward (known as a “bull” market) will reverse direction and start moving in a downward direction, or become a “bear” market—or vice versa. When a reversal graph pattern appears, it shows that investors have been testing the current trend, and for one reason or another they don't find it viable or sustainable—thus the market changes direction.

## S

### **Satoshi**
* Currently, this is the smallest possible fraction of cryptocurrency available for transactions. It refers to 0.00000001 Bitcoin, and is named after Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic creator of the first publicly-available digital currency. Nakamoto wrote the white paper in 2008 that evolved into the creation of Bitcoin—and until March 2014, no one had been able to pin down the true identity of the person or persons operating under the pseudonym. An expose in Newsweek Magazine at that time revealed that Satoshi Nakamoto was, indeed, the creator of Bitcoin's real name.

### **Scrypt**
* Scrypt is a type of mining algorithm, and it's used by major cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin and Novacoin. It has the one major advantage over other algorithms such as SHA-256 in that it's quicker and easier to use. It doesn't use up as much computer processing space or time, so individual miners can more readily process [blocks](https://bitfalls.com/2017/08/20/blockchain-explained-blockchain-works/) of data with it.

### **Sell Order**
* This takes place when an investor approaches an exchange with the intent to sell some or all of their cryptocurrency investment. Sometimes sell orders are simple and straight to the point (“Just sell what I have at the best price you can find”), or the investor can set criteria that have to be met before the sale can be made. 

### **SHA-256**
* This is a mining algorithm protocol used by cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Peercoin. While a popular algorithm, SHA-256 tends to use a lot more computing power and processing time than others, so it can be more difficult for individual miners to use. As a result, the majority of SHA-256 mining is performed by mining pools or individual miners who have separate computers they can devote solely to mining.

### **Shitcoin**
* this is not necessarily a bad term. Traders don’t avoid a coin because it is a shitcoin. I have seen traders rally a coin with a broken blockchain. Just never fool yourself and start believing in a shitcoin. (Like Dodgecoin).

### **Silk Road**
* This was the notorious online black marketplace where drug deals and money laundering occurred on a regular basis. Many of the transactions on Silk Road used cryptocurrencies, which gave the entire industry a black eye for a while. After a long FBI investigation, Silk Road's owner was arrested in October of 2013, and the entire operation was shut down. ([Monero]( https://bitfalls.com/2017/09/20/moneros-secret-project-fundraiser-high-profile-merchants/) was used as the most untraceable of all Crypto and is not all that bad)

### **Stale Block**
* When a [block](https://bitfalls.com/2017/08/20/blockchain-explained-blockchain-works/) of cryptocurrency data has been successfully processed by a miner or mining pool, that block of data is considered stale. Experienced miners know to skip stale blocks, for it would be a waste of their time to try to mine them again.

### **Stop-Loss Order**
* This is a standing “get me out of here!” sell order that investors in stocks or commodities (such as cryptocurrency) use to, well...stop their losses. Or at least minimize them.
* Investors often establish a stop-loss order the minute they make a purchase. This is a sell order that specifies the price at which the currency should be sold. For example, if you buy shares of something at '$100 each, you might decide to issue a stop-loss order at $60'. As long as the share price remains above that number, all is well—and nothing will happen unless you contact the exchange personally. However, the second the price hits $60, all or part of your currency (whichever you specify) will be sold at your stop-loss order price. Different exchanges treat this differently; some sell immediately, and some wait to see if it's just a momentary “hiccup” on the market; if the price falls below your stop-loss limit, you'll get the latter amount for your shares. Stop loss orders are not the best options always. See more [here](http://fortune.com/2017/06/22/ethereum-crash/). Luckily Coinbase reimbursed the people who lost money due to this. 

## T

### **To the moon!**
* A rallying cry for bitcoin’s price to rise sky-high. It has sparked existential questions—”Can we please define ‘moon’?“
 
### **Trading Walls**
* Generally speaking, the trend line on a chart will move more or less diagonally as trades are made. However, once in a while there is a buy or sell order that comes in which will make the trend line move directly up and down, creating a vertical line that resembles a wall. These “walls” represent a temporary high demand in interest, either in buying or selling a certain type of digital currency. If a wall is created by a large buy order, it's called a “buy wall,” and if it represents a sizable sell order, it's called a “sell wall.” 

### **Transaction Fee**
* Most trades and purchase made with cryptocurrency include a small transaction fee. This fee is fed into the data [block](https://bitfalls.com/2017/08/20/blockchain-explained-blockchain-works/) that contains the transaction's information, and all or part of the transaction fee will be rewarded to the miner or mining pool that successfully processes that block.

### **Triangle Pattern**
* Generally speaking, triangle patterns form on market value charts when investors buy and sell to test a current trend. The highs and lows of these fluctuations can be bracketed by straight lines that define the highs and lows during that testing period; these lines form an open-ended triangular shape.
* There are three types of triangle patterns:

>Descending Triangle. This is formed when the lower line of the triangle is a horizontal line, and the upper line tilts downward from left to right. The descending triangle represents a downward-trending, or “bear,” market.
>
>Ascending Triangle. This is the inverse of the descending triangle, with an upward left-to-right tilted line at the bottom, and a horizontal line at the top. Ascending triangle patterns indicate an upcoming “bull,” or upward-trending, market.
>
>Symmetrical Triangle. The symmetrical triangle stands out because both lines forming the triangle are tilted. It's also a trickier pattern to predict, because it can continue in either an upward (“bullish”) or downward (“bearish”) direction.

### **Trollbox** 
* Is the chat box that sits on the fringes of a trading screen. All that happens on in the Trollbox should be taken with more than just a grain of salt. It is what you would generally expect from any chatroom on the internet, populated primarily by teenage to middle aged males, however I would argue that cryptocurrency trollboxes add cash to the mix.

## W

### **Wallet**
* Just like a bill-and-coin wallet, this is a place to keep your digital currency. There are four types of cryptocurrency [wallets](https://bitfalls.com/2017/08/31/what-cryptocurrency-wallet/):
>
>Software Wallet. These are programs you load onto your desktop or laptop computer.
>
>Mobile Wallet: These come in the form of applications you install on your smartphone or tablet computer. They usually include QR code scanning and phone-to-phone transfers for on-the-go transactions.
>
>Web Wallet: These are usually gotten through exchanges, and stored on third-party servers via cloud computing. They can be accessed by any computing device.
>
>Paper Wallet: Your digital currency can be printed out—usually in the form of QR codes—and these hard-copy cryptocurrency “bills” can be kept in a physical wallet just like traditional money.


### **Wedge Pattern**
* These are a type of “continuation” pattern you'll see on market value graphs; that means they represent a momentary shift against the current trend. The trend tends to continue in the direction it was going once the pattern is fully formed. Wedge patterns can be spotted by two diagonal, but non-converging, lines that bracket the up-and-down fluctuations that occur while investors test the current trend. There are three types of wedge patterns:
>
>Rising Wedge. This wedge shape is tilted upward; thus, the name. However, a rising wedge occurs during a downward trend, or “bear” market. It's a momentary upward shift, but the bear market continued afterward.
>
>Falling Wedge. The falling wedge is tilted downward. It represents just the opposite of the rising wedge, in that it denotes a brief downward movement during a “bull” market, which continues once the wedge is formed.
>
>Level Wedge. These appear to move in more or less a horizontal direction on a graph. Just like the rising and falling wedges, the level wedge shows a brief respite in a trend, which will continue once the wedge pattern is complete.

### **Whale**
* In finance, a whale is usually a very wealthy investor or institution. In crypto, it can mean a person in your family living in your basement who borrowed two grand from you - the Parent.

## Z

### **Zero Confirmation Transaction**
* The processing of data for cryptocurrency transactions can take anywhere from half a minute upward to over ten minutes in some cases. Though this is necessary in order to validate transactions—and guards against fraudulent activity such as double spending—the waiting period can be inconvenient for those involved in the transactions. As a result, some exchanges and businesses that deal with digital currency are offering “zero confirmation” transactions, which are almost immediately verified without waiting for the mining process to confirm the data [block](https://bitfalls.com/2017/08/20/blockchain-explained-blockchain-works/).
